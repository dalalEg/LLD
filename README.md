# 🧠 Low-Level Design (LLD) Practice – Self-Designed Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to Low-Level Design (LLD) problems. The problem descriptions are sourced from [Algomaster](https://algomaster.io/learn/lld), and the implementations are crafted to reinforce object-oriented principles, clean architecture, and thoughtful design patterns.

## ✨ Goals & Philosophy

- ✅ Apply core **software design principles** like SOLID, DRY, and Separation of Concerns
- 🔍 Practice **real-world modeling** through well-structured classes and interactions
- 🧪 Prepare for system design interviews and improve architectural thinking
- 🚧 Continuously improve code quality and design clarity

## 🔮 In Progress

I plan to tackle more challenges from the Algomaster LLD series, with a focus on designing scalable, maintainable systems. Upcoming projects may include:

- Parking Lot System
- Splitwise Clone
- BookMyShow Clone
- Airline Management System

## 💡 Note

These solutions reflect my own interpretation and design decisions. While not necessarily canonical, they aim to stay as close as possible to best practices in software engineering.
